\section{Approach}
\subsection{Threat Model of Tag Designs}
The attacks discussed in this article mainly situated on the probing and
tampering the data transferred between chip and external memory. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The attacker monitoring the data and try to interpreted the meaning.
This kind of attacks, named passive attacks in some articles, threats the confidentiality of the data.
	\item The attacker try to modify the valid data  on the transferring path and on
the memory by injecting malicious data. This kind of attacks, named active attacks, threats the integrity of the data.
\end{itemize}
The objective of active attacks effecting the behaviour of the system by
tampering the data used. We categorize active attacks to two degrees according
to the resources of injected data.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introducing new data attack: the adversary introduces malicious data
within a write-read period. 
	\item Replaying valid data attack:
\end{itemize}
